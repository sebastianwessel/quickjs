# 🚀 Announcing Version 2.0

After months of hard work, **QuickJS Version 2.0** is finally here! 🎉

This release brings **major improvements**, including a complete rewrite of the **data exchange layer** between the guest and host. The API has been **simplified**, making it easier than ever to work with **JavaScript sandboxes** while providing even more control.

Along with **bug fixes**, **TypeScript support**, **async execution**, and **enhanced configurability**, we've also revamped the **official website** to provide better documentation and examples.

Let’s dive into what’s new! 🔥

---

## ✨ What’s New in QuickJS 2.0?

### 🔁 Re-Use of Context

With QuickJS v2, you can now **reuse the same sandboxed context multiple times**, making execution more efficient.

#### ✅ Example

```ts
import { type SandboxOptions, loadQuickJs } from "@sebastianwessel/quickjs";

const options: SandboxOptions = {
  // [...]
};

const { runSandboxed } = await loadQuickJs();

const finalResult = await runSandboxed(async ({ evalCode }) => {
  const firstResult = await evalCode("// [...code 1]");
  console.log("Step 1:", firstResult);

  // Run second call
  return evalCode("// [...code 2]");
}, options);

console.log(finalResult);
```

Now, you can **execute multiple pieces of code inside the same sandboxed context** without needing to create a new instance each time.

---

### 🟦 TypeScript Support

**TypeScript execution is now supported natively!** 🎉

To enable it, just install the `typescript` package and set `transformTypescript: true` in the sandbox options.

🔹 **Note:** This does **not** perform type checking. It simply **transpiles TypeScript to JavaScript**, allowing TypeScript code to be executed in the sandbox.

---

### ⏳ Full Async Support

With **QuickJS v2**, you can now use **asynchronous execution** via the **Emscripten async variant**. This means:

✅ **Dynamic imports at runtime**
✅ **Fetching dependencies from sources like [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/)**

#### 🛠️ How to Use the Async Version

Simply replace:

```ts
import { loadQuickJs } from "@sebastianwessel/quickjs";
```

with:

```ts
import { loadAsyncQuickJs } from "@sebastianwessel/quickjs";
```

Now, your sandbox can dynamically load modules and dependencies at runtime! 🚀

---

### ⚙️ Enhanced Configuration

The sandbox is now **more customizable than ever**!

✅ **Customizable module path resolver**
✅ **Custom module loader**
✅ **Fine-grained control over execution behavior**

These improvements allow developers to configure **precisely how modules are loaded** and how the sandbox interacts with the environment.

---

## 📌 Use Cases

To help users get started, **three new use cases** have been added to the website, with **source code available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sebastianwessel/quickjs)**.

### 🤖 1. Execute AI-Generated Code

A Large Language Model (LLM) generates JavaScript code to solve a given task. The **QuickJS sandbox** executes the AI-generated code, and the **result is passed back** to the LLM for further processing.

🔗 **Try it here**: [Execute AI-Generated Code](../use-cases/ai-generated-code.md)

---

### 🛡️ 2. Secure Execution of User-Generated Code

Running user-created code **safely** is a challenge. With QuickJS, **sandboxing JavaScript execution** takes just a few lines of code!

🔗 **Check it out**: [User Generated Code](../use-cases/user-generated-code.md)

---

### 🌍 **3. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**

QuickJS can also be used for **server-side rendering** (SSR) in a **secure, isolated environment**.

🔗 **See the example**: [Serverside Rendering](../use-cases/serverside-rendering.md)

---

## 🚀 Migration Guide: QuickJS v1 → v2

QuickJS v2 **introduces changes** to improve the developer experience and expand capabilities. If you're upgrading from **v1**, here’s what you need to know:

### 📦 New Dependency Management

Previously, QuickJS was shipped with:
`@jitl/quickjs-ng-wasmfile-release-sync`

Now, you must install **your preferred QuickJS WebAssembly variant** separately.

#### 📥 Install the New Package

Use the package manager of your choice:

```sh
# npm
npm install @jitl/quickjs-ng-wasmfile-release-sync

# bun
bun add @jitl/quickjs-ng-wasmfile-release-sync

# yarn
yarn add @jitl/quickjs-ng-wasmfile-release-sync
```

This **separates QuickJS from the runtime**, allowing **more flexibility** in choosing the variant that best fits your needs.

---

### 🔄 Updated API Usage

####

Before (QuickJS v1)

```ts
import { quickJS } from "@sebastianwessel/quickjs";

const { createRuntime } = await quickJS();
const { evalCode } = await createRuntime(options);

const result = await evalCode(code);
console.log(result);
```

#### After (QuickJS v2)

```ts
import { type SandboxOptions, loadQuickJs } from "@sebastianwessel/quickjs";

const { runSandboxed } = await loadQuickJs();

const code = `
import { join } from 'path'

const fn = async () => {
  console.log(join('src', 'dist')) // Logs "src/dist" on the host system
  console.log(env.MY_ENV_VAR) // Logs "env var value" on the host system

  const url = new URL('https://example.com')
  const f = await fetch(url)
  return f.text()
}

export default await fn()
`;

const options: SandboxOptions = {
  allowFetch: true, // Allow network requests
  allowFs: true, // Enable virtual file system
  env: { MY_ENV_VAR: "env var value" },
};

const result = await runSandboxed(async ({ evalCode }) => evalCode(code));
console.log(result);
```

💡 **Key Differences:**

- `loadQuickJs()` replaces `quickJS()`
- `runSandboxed()` simplifies execution
- Modular approach for **better control & flexibility**

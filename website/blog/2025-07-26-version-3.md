# QuickJS Version 3.0 — Breaking Changes Ahead!

We're excited to announce **Version 3.0** of `@sebastianwessel/quickjs`! This release introduces a **breaking change** in how the **WASM module** is loaded, improving **security** and providing a **clearer separation** between the runtime and its dependencies.

> If you're upgrading from a previous version, please read this post carefully to avoid runtime errors.

## WASM Module Must Now Be Explicitly Imported

To comply with **stricter security restrictions in Node.js** and to allow better customization, the `loadAsyncQuickJs` and `loadQuickJs` functions **no longer provide default module fallbacks**.

### New Required Usage (Async):

```ts
import variant from "@jitl/quickjs-wasmfile-release-asyncify";
const { runSandboxed } = await loadAsyncQuickJs(variant);
```

### New Required Usage (Sync):

```ts
import variant from "@jitl/quickjs-ng-wasmfile-release-sync";
const { runSandboxed } = loadQuickJs(variant);
```

### Old Usage (No Longer Supported):

```ts
// ❌ These will now throw an error
const { runSandboxed } = await loadAsyncQuickJs();
const { runSandboxed } = loadQuickJs();
```

This change ensures that the host application **explicitly declares which WASM variant** it intends to use, improving clarity and maintainability — especially in advanced environments like bundlers or serverless runtimes.
